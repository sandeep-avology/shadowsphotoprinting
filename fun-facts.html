                    <h3>Fun facts about printing </h3>
                    <p>Have you or did you know that we do all our printing in sRGB? <br>
                        The printer prints in sRGB, and it will convert the CMYK mode to the sRGB before printing.
                        <br>
                        sRGB encompasses only 35% of all visible colors.
                        <br>
                        While it produces more colors than any CMYK color space, The reason is that most of the <br> sRGB
                        colour space is printable across a range of devices.
                    </p>
                    <p>Why do we use RGB or Adobe 1998 because of the greater range of colour’s as CMYK cannot <br> produce
                        brighter colours.
                        <br>
                        These hues are beyond the CMYK range and will come out daker and duller when printed.
                    </p>
                    <P>We always suggest that you always make your image a little lighter than what is on your <br> display
                        or device before printing as the printer will always print daker than what you see on <br> your
                        display or device.
                    </P>
                    <p class="color_yellow"><strong>Setting your files!
                        </strong></p>

                   <p>Save your files at <strong>300ppi (pixels per inch)</strong> and the correct print size you are ordering <br> example (
                        <strong>12 x 18 inches at 300 ppi)</strong> Save your files as .jpeg (our software only accepts .jpeg <br> files) and
                        make sure your file name is no longer than 33 characters and if you need more <br> than one copy of
                        the file can you please kindly add qty and the number of prints to be <br>printed at the front of
                        the file name. Example <strong>(qty2shadowsphotoprinting.JPEG) </strong> and before <br> saving please ensure that the
                        colour space is saved in <strong>sRGB, RGB</strong> or <strong>Adobe1998.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>Before printing we convert the files with our printing profile ensuring amazing quality.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Setting Greyscale Files!
                    </h4>
                    <p>Please check your files if you are working in a greyscale as if you leave the source space as<br>
                        working grey dot 20% Adobe ACE our sure lab order control won’t process the file correctly, and
                        this is <br> why they can come out looking green.
                    </p>

                    <P>Please check you flies are set correctly as sRGB for printing via the following instructions <br>
                        below before you upload them for printing!
                    </P>
                    <P>You will need to open the file into photoshop and go to edit and then to convert to profile and
                        select <br> SRGB click ok and save the file.
                    </P>
                    <P>As we do not change these files that are set as a source space as working grey dot 20% Adobe <br> ACE.
                        This is up to you to have your files set correctly for the best quality of printing!
                    </P>
                    <h4>Have you had your monitor calibrated?
                    </h4>
                    <p>As this is a good idea for photo editing no matter what your profession.
                    </p>
                    <p>As a photographer this is especially important! A monitor colour calibration ensures that the
                        <br>
                        edits you apply to a photo are accurate.
                    </p>
                    <p>It also helps to ensure that your prints look as good as they did on your monitor and all other
                        <br>
                        calibrated monitors.
                    </p>
                    <p>We calibrate or monitor regularly and check the settings in our editing program to make sure <br>
                        that
                        we are set at <strong> sRGB </strong> or <strong>RGB, Adobe 1998.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <h4>What colour background do you use in your photo editing software?
                    </h4>
                    <p>We use a grey background in our photo editing software as grey is useful because it is subtle
                        <br> and
                        tends to focus attention on the subject. This is a good option for portraiture <br> photography.
                    </p>
                    <h4>RATIOS – ASPECT RATIO
                    </h4>
                    <p>Aspect ratio is the relationship of width of an image to its height, of its horizontal to
                        vertical <br> dimensions. Some digital cameras let you select an aspect ratio that matches
                        standard
                        print <br> sizes, such as 6”x4” (3:2 ratio) Some digital cameras default to different ratios,
                        the
                        most <br> common other than 3:2ratio is 4:3 ratio.
                    </p>
                    <p>For files not shot in a 3:2 ratio, care must be taken to get the desired aspect ratio with <br>
                        editing software as photos will need to be the same ratio as the print selected or <strong>
                            WHITE <br> EDGES
                            WILL APPEAR ON YOUR FINISIED PRINTS.</strong> This also can happen if you have cropped <br>
                        your file in some
                        way.
                    </p>
                    <p>If you are selecting a border on your prints and you don’t have the correct ratio, those prints
                        <br>
                        will have an <strong>odd sized border on some sides,</strong> if you say a
                        <strong>14”x11”</strong> you would need to place <br> the
                        <strong>14:11 ratio</strong> on a <strong>12”x18”</strong> canvas <strong>(ie:3:2)</strong>
                        ratio canvas.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Question!
                    </h4>
                    <p>I am unhappy with my photo as I saved a 14”x11” and they all came back out with larger <br> with white
                        edges on the side!
                    </p>
                    <h4>Answer!
                    </h4>
                    <p>We print your files to <strong> (FIT ON WHATEVER SIZED MEDIA (PAPER) YOU CHOSE). </strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>You chose 12”x18” so they <strong>FIT on the media (paper) as follows:</strong> The 11” side will
                        go to 12” <br> and the 14” side will go to 15.273, so you will have in front of you 15.273”x12”
                        prints.
                    </p>
                    <p>If you want to make <strong>14”x11”</strong> enlargements you will need to make them <strong>
                            14”x11” </strong> on a <br> <strong>12”x18”</strong> canvas
                        <strong>
                            (image> Canvas Size in Photoshop),
                        </strong> then you simply print them as 12”x18 <br> and you will have the
                        14”x11” inside the border you created in Photoshop.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Question!
                    </h4>
                    <p>What Pixels should I export out of my Scrapbooking Program?

                        <strong> 8”x8”, 10”x10”</strong> and <br> <strong>12”x12”.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <h4>Borders
                    </h4>
                    <p>We recommend a 4mm white border if your prints are to be framed or if you’re not sure <br> about
                        the
                        ratio.
                    </p>
                    <p>The 4mm border doesn’t bleed out but sometimes you might notice a slight skew on the <br> white
                        edge
                        <strong>
                            (less than 5mm),
                        </strong> reason for this is that the media <strong>(paper)</strong> must go through a lot
                        <br>of guides, and
                        it needs a bit of give, so that travels smoothly through the machine. Hence <br> the reason for
                        bleeding happens.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Bleeding</h4>
                    <p>Please note our printer will crop <strong> 2-3</strong>% from the outer edge of the image through
                        bleeding.
                    </p>
                    <p>If you do not wish to lose any of the image, please specify borders on your prints and this <br>
                        will
                        a 4mm white (or another colour if you wish) border. The main problem that is incurred is <br>
                        when
                        you have text near the edges or need something close to the edge of the photo.</p>
